# Factory

This almost certainly won't compile.

It's a Processing project done using NetBeans so there are a bunch of changes that needed to be made for that
(mostly having to pass the PApplet into lower classes).

You'll need the libraries from recent Processing installation, specifically the processing core, opengl and peasycam libraries.
Installation / use / refering of these differs per operating system.

It's also missing a build script. I've been using NetBeans and the build.xml that generates, but i'm not sure of the value
of committing that here, especially given the two points above.

I will make this better.

Anyway, the project allows you to create diagrams of systems and have messages passing through them. I'll add a screenshot.
